## Thesaurus for Non-Techies 🧠

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#ultimate-privacy-guide-)**

In this section, we break down some common tech and privacy terms that might be unfamiliar to beginners. This is to make the world of online privacy easier to navigate!

---

- **DNS (Domain Name System)** 🌐  
  **What it means**: DNS is like the phone book of the internet. It translates website names (like google.com) into IP addresses (the technical address where websites live).  
  **Why it matters**: DNS services can affect your internet speed, security, and privacy. Some DNS services, like NextDNS or AdGuard Home, offer extra protection by blocking malicious sites.

---

- **End-to-End Encryption** 🔐  
  **What it means**: A method of communication where only the sender and the recipient can read the message. Even the service provider (like Proton Mail) can't access the contents.  
  **Why it matters**: It ensures that your data or messages are private and secure, from your device to the recipient's device.

---

- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** 🛡️  
  **What it means**: A tool that hides your online activity by routing your connection through a private server, making it harder for websites and hackers to track you.  
  **Why it matters**: VPNs protect your data, especially on public Wi-Fi, and can also bypass geographic restrictions on content.

---

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** 🔑  
  **What it means**: A security process that requires two types of information (usually a password and a code sent to your phone) to verify your identity when logging in.  
  **Why it matters**: It adds an extra layer of protection, making it harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they know your password.

---

- **Browser Fingerprinting** 🖥️  
  **What it means**: A method websites use to track you by collecting information about your browser, device, and settings. This creates a "fingerprint" unique to you.  
  **Why it matters**: It's a sneaky way websites can identify and track you even if you block cookies or use privacy tools.

---

- **Telemetry** 📊  
  **What it means**: Data collected by software (like browsers) about how you use it. This data is often sent back to the company to improve performance or features.  
  **Why it matters**: While sometimes helpful, telemetry can also be invasive, collecting more data than necessary.

---

- **No-Logs Policy** 📜  
  **What it means**: A promise by VPN or other online service providers that they do not keep records (logs) of your activity or personal information.  
  **Why it matters**: A no-logs policy ensures that your online activity stays private, even if the service provider is hacked or legally pressured.

---

- **Ad Blocking** 🚫  
  **What it means**: A tool or extension that stops ads from displaying on websites. uBlock Origin is a popular example.
